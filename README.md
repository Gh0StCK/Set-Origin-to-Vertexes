# Set Origin to Vertexes

The Blender addon does a simple thing that Blender seems to be missing, which is to set an object's Origin between the selected vetrexes. Thus, it allows you to save time and not perform additional actions if you need to perform such a manipulation.

Create in the Edit tab in the N-panel, a new item for interaction.

Version Blender 3.4.1
